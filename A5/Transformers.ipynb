We will implement a simpler version here, where the simplicity arise from the task that we are solving, which is a vector-to-vector task.

The resultant Embeddings are then transformed into three vectors, *query*, *key*, and *value* using learnable weights and we then use a Transformer Encoder and Decoder to get the final output sequence. For this section, we will assume that we have the *query*, *key*, and the *value* vector and work on them.\n","\n","In the above figure, you can see that the Encoder has multihead attention block is right after these blocks. There is also a masked multihead attention in the deocoder but we will see that it's easy to implement the masked attention when we have implemented the basic MultiHeadAttention block.\n","To implement the basic MultiheadAttention block, we will first implement the Self Attention block and see that MultiHeadAttention can be implemented as a direct extension of the Self Attention block.\n","\n","## Self Attention Block\n","\n","Taking inspiration from information retreival paradigm, Transformers have this notion of *query*, *key*, and *value* where given a *query* we try extract information from *key*-*value* pairs. Moving along those lines, we perform this mathematically by taking the weighted sum of *values* for each *query*, where weight is computed by dot product of *query* and the *key*. More precisely, for each query we compute the dot product with all the keys and then use the scalar output of those dot products as weights to find the weighted sum of *values*. Note that before finding the weighted sum, we also apply softmax function to the weights vector. Lets start with implementing of Attention Block that takes input as *query*, *key*, and *value* vectors and returns a Tensor, that is weighted sum of the *values*.\n","\n","For this section, you need to implement three functions, `scaled_dot_product_two_loop_single`, `scaled_dot_product_two_loop_batch`, and `scaled_dot_product_no_loop_batch` inside the transformers.py file. This might look very similar to the `dot_product_attention` in the RNN notebook but there is a subtle difference in the inputs.

In the  class we learned about encoder only model that can be used for tasks like sequence classification but for more complicated tasks like sequence to sequence we need a decoder network that can transform the output of the encoder to a target sequence. This kind of architecture is important in tasks like language translation where we have a sequence as input and a sequence as output. This decoder takes the input from the encoder and the previous generated value to generate the next value. During training, we use a Mask on the input so that the decoder network can't look ahead in the future and during inference we sequentially process the data.\n","\n","Before moving to implementing the Decoder Block, we should pay attention to the figure above. It says a \"Masked MultiHead Attention\" which actually prevents the decoder from looking ahead into the future. Lets understand with an example here. We have an expression as `BOS POSITIVE 01 add POSITIVE 00 EOS`, i.e. `1+0` that gives output as `BOS POSITIVE 01 EOS`, i.e. `+1`. Lets focus on the output sequence here. This is a sequence of length 5 (after applying our preprocessing code) and will will get transformed into *key*, *query*, and *value* matrix of dimension $5\\times128$, $5\\times128$ and $5\\times128$ respectively, where 128 is the embedding dimension of the Transformer. Now, while training, we input these vectors in the `self_attention_no_loop_batch` without mask. It will compute the dot product between *query* and *key* to generate a $5\\times5$ matrix where the first row (shape $1\\times5$) of that matrix tells us how much the word `EOS` is related with `EOS`, `POSITIVE`, `0`, `1`, and `EOS`. This means that it will use the weights of all these tokens to learn the final sequence that is to be predicted. This is okay when we are training the model but what happens when we perform inference? We start with a brand new expression, input this expression in the encoder but this time we only have the first starting token `EOS` for decoder and we don't know about the rest of the tokens in the sequence. Hence, a solution to this problem is to mask the weights inside the function `self_attention_no_loop_batch` for only the decoder part. This masking should prevent the decoder from accessing the future or next elements.\n","\n","We will now look at how to generate this mask for a given sequence. Then, you should also update the `self_attention_no_loop_batch` to use the mask variable appropriately.

This will ensure that the implementation is correct. We keep the training and validation data same here. Before doing that, a couple of things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- We implemented two versions of positional encodings: simple and sinusoid. For overfitting, we will use the simple positional encoding but feel free to experiment with both when training for the complete model\n","- In transformers.py, we have implemented two loss functions for you. The first is the familiar cross entropy loss and second is the `LabelSmoothingLoss`. For overfitting, we will use the cross entropy loss but feel free to experiment with both while doing experiment with the complete data.\n","- Usually, the training regime of Transformers start with a warmup, in other words, we train the model with a lower learning rate for some iterations and then increasing the learning rate to make the network learn faster. Intuitively, this helps you to attain a stable manifold in the loss function and then we increase the learning rate to learn faster in this stable manifold. In a way we are warming up the network to be in a stable manifold and we start training with a higher learning rate after this warm-up. For overfitting we have NOT used this warm-up as for such small data, it is okay to start with a higer learning rate but you should keep this in mind while training with the complete data. We have used two functions from a5_helper.py, `train` and `val`. Here, `train` has three parameters that you should pay attention to:\n","  - `warmup_interval`: Specifies the number of iterations that the network should train with a low learning rate. In other words, its the number of iterations after which the network will have the higher learning rate\n","  - `warmup_lr`: This is the learning rate that will be used during warmup.\n","  - `lr`: This is the learning rate that will get used after the warm-up. If warmup_interval is None, we will start training with this learning rate.\n","\n","In the following cells for overfitting, we have used the number of epochs as 200 but you could increase this. You should get an accuracy ~1 in 200 epochs. It might be a little lower as well, don't worry about it. It should take about a minute to run the overfitting.\n","\n","NOTE: When we say epoch, it means the number of times we have taken a complete pass over the data.
